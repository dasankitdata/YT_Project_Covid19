# YT_Project_Covid19
A Data Analytics project on the Covid19 data.

This Portfolio project is implemented on SQL (MySQL), CSV files, Python and Tableau.

## The Data Source
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## What is analysed? The Problem in hand
The covid-deaths data has a pleathora of features which can be analyzed and of those a few are picked in this project.
The first of which is the DEATHS and second is VACCINATIONS. The main focus is on India (my country of residence) and the data is taken from August 1st of 2020 right about the middle of the 2nd corona virus wave in India as confirmed by NCBI.GOV of India

## Why is the 2nd wave analysed? The wave of virus which "Hit India like a Tsunami"
The newspapers and TV channels were flooded with reportings of death, hospitalizations, lack of oxygen cylinders and several other painful data, thus exploring this time frame seems justifiable.
